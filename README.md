# Whimsical Folly Bakery and Tea House — Local Static Site

This repository contains a small static website scaffold created by ChatGPT. Use it as a starting point for the Whimsical Folly Bakery and Tea House landing page.

Quick preview (Python 3):

```bash
# from the repository root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Files added:
- `index.html` — main page
- `css/styles.css` — styling
- `js/main.js` — small interactive bits

Next steps you might ask for:
- Add real images and assets in an `assets/` folder
- Turn sections into component partials if moving to a templating system
- Add a simple deploy step (GitHub Pages / Netlify) — tell me which and I can scaffold it

Editing content in-browser
- Open the site locally (see above) and click the `Edit` button in the header to toggle edit mode.
- Editable regions are highlighted; change text directly.
- Use `Save` to persist edits to `localStorage` (your browser). Use `Export HTML` to download the current page as an HTML file.
- `Reset` will clear saved edits and restore original content.
